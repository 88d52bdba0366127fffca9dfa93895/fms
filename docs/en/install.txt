FMS download and installation

Downloading FMS
===============

FMS packages are available in various formats, suitable for different operating
systems. Download links :

* ``tar.gz`` package : http://bagneris.net/contents/dld/fms-0.1.0.tar.gz 

* ``zip`` package : http://bagneris.net/contents/dld/fms-0.1.0.zip

* Windows installer : http://bagneris.net/contents/dld/fms-0.1.0.win32.exe

In addition, you may clone the source repository of FMS. As it is managed with
`the git VCS`_, you need first to install it, then to get the repository run::

    git clone git://git.assembla.com/fmsdev.git

If you develop new classes or squash bugs, consider sending a patch, or asking
for pull access on the repository.

Installing FMS
==============

Requirements
------------

- A working installation of the Python language (http://www.python.org), version
  should be 2.4 or greater.

- The PyYaml library (http://pyyaml.org/) is necessary to read configuration
  files.

Linux and BSD distributions
---------------------------

Get the source package (see `downloading FMS`_ above), uncompress it wherever
you think is a suitable place (``usr/local/src/`` might seem a clever choice,
though). 

``cd`` to the newly created directory.  Then run this command (as root) from a
command prompt::

    python setup.py install


As an alternative, you may just copy or link the ``fms`` directory in your
Python's installation ``site-packages`` directory.

In addition, you may move the ``fms.py`` script somewhere on your path.

To check that anything went well, ``cd`` to the tests directory and run::

	python runalltests.py

Windows
-------

Ah. Windows. As I do not use it, I tried to do my best to provide a usable
package.

Your best bet is probably to get the Windows FMS installer (see `downloading
FMS`_ above) and put it somewhere on the desktop, then double-click on it
(shudder) and give sensible answers on the traditional questions about where you
would like it to be installed.

Then you may run FMS from IDLE or from the command line.

Running FMS from IDLE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IDLE stands for Integrated DeveLopment Environment, and is mainly used on
Windows systems. Once Python is installed on your system, IDLE might be started
from the Python submenu in the main menu.

Although it is meant as a development environment, IDLE is able to run scripts
(passing options and arguments to them). See IDLE documentation for detailed
information on how to run scripts from IDLE.

Running FMS from the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you prefer to run FMS from the command line, then cd to FMS's installation
directory and try::

    python fms.py

If all goes well, you should get this output::

    Usage: fms.py [options] [command] simulationconffile

    runs a Financial Market Simulator simulation

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose         Set logging level to 'info'. Overrided by --loglevel.
      -L LEVEL, --loglevel=LEVEL
                            Set logging level to LEVEL: debug, info, warning,
                            error, critical.
    CRITICAL - fms - Missing command name.

If instead you get an error message yelling that the system is unable to find
something called ``python`` on your machine, then the python executable is
probably not on the search path of your system. Read below to know how to add it.

.. rubric:: Excerpt from the `Python tutorial`_:

On Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in
``C:\Python26``, though you can change this when youâ€™re running the installer.
To add this directory to your path, you can type the following command into the
command prompt in a DOS box::

    set path=%path%;C:\python26

Uninstalling FMS
================

If you need/want to uninstall FMS, ``cd`` to your Python's installation
``site-packages`` directory, and remove fms directory and egg-info file::

	rm -r fms*

Then remove the ``fms.py`` script from where it was installed, probably
``/usr/bin/`` or ``/usr/local/bin/`` on Unix. 

On Windows, if you used the binary installer, you may uninstall FMS directly
from the application managing all installed programs. Otherwise, go to your
Python installation directory (usually ``C:\Python26``), then to the
``Site-packages`` directory, and delete anything fms-related in it (probably a
directory called ``fms``).

You're done. Thanks for giving FMS a try !
