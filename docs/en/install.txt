FMS download and installation

Downloading FMS
===============

FMS packages are available in various formats, suitable for different operating
systems. Download links :

* ``tar.gz`` package : http://bagneris.net/contents/dld/fms-0.1.0.tar.gz 

* ``zip`` package : http://bagneris.net/contents/dld/fms-0.1.0.zip

* Windows installer : http://bagneris.net/contents/dld/fms-0.1.0.win32.exe

In addition, you may clone the source repository of FMS. As it is managed with
`the git VCS`_, you need first to install it, then to get the repository run::

    git clone git://git.assembla.com/fmsdev.git

If you develop new classes or squash bugs, consider sending a patch, or asking
for pull access on the repository.

Installing FMS
==============

Requirements
------------

- A working installation of the Python language (http://www.python.org), version
  should be 2.4 or greater.

- The PyYaml library (http://pyyaml.org/) is necessary to read configuration
  files.

Linux and BSD distributions
---------------------------

Get the source package (see `downloading FMS`_ above), uncompress it wherever
you think is a suitable place (``usr/local/src/`` might seem a clever choice,
though). 

``cd`` to the newly created directory.  Then run this command (as root) from a
command prompt::

    python setup.py install


As an alternative, you may just copy or link the ``fms`` directory in your
Python's installation ``site-packages`` directory.

In addition, you may move the ``fms.py`` script somewhere on your path.

To check that anything went well, ``cd`` to the tests directory and run::

	./runalltests.py

Windows
-------

Ah. Windows. As I do not use it, I tried to do my best to provide with a usable
package. Hopefully some colleague of mine will give me a chance to test the
installation on his computer, and I will post more detailed instructions here.

Your best bet is probably to get the Windows FMS installer (see `downloading
FMS`_ above) and put it somewhere on the desktop, then double-click on it
(shudder) and give sensible answers on the traditional questions about where you
would like it to be installed.

Uninstalling FMS
================

If you need/want to uninstall FMS, ``cd`` to your Python's installation
``site-packages`` directory, and remove fms directory and egg-info file::

	rm -r fms*

Then remove the ``fms.py`` script from where it was installed, probably
``/usr/bin/`` or ``/usr/local/bin/`` on Unix. 

You're done. Thanks for giving FMS a try !
