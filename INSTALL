Thanks for downloading FMS.

Requirements
============

- A working installation of the Python language (http://www.python.org), version
  should be 2.4 or greater.
- The PyYaml library (http://pyyaml.org/) is necessary to read configuration
  files.

Installing FMS
==============

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.4 or greater installed. Then run
this command (as root) from a command prompt:

    python setup.py install


As an alternative, you may just copy or link the fms directory in your
Python's installation site-packages directory.

In addition, you may move the 'fms.py' script somewhere on your path.

See the docs/ directory for more detailed installation steps, especially if you
intend to run FMS on Windows.

To check that anything went well, cd to the tests directory and run:

	python runalltests.py

Uninstalling FMS
================

If you need/want to uninstall FMS, cd to your Python's installation
site-packages directory, and remove fms directory and egg-info file :

	rm -r fms*

Then remove the fms.py script from where it was installed, probably /usr/bin 
or /usr/local/bin on Unix. 

You're done. Thanks for giving FMS a try !
