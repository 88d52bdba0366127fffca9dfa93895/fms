--- # Experiment 01
# This file is part of FMS, a Financial Market Simulator
#
# This experiment simulates an asynchronous and continuous market,
# driven by order books. The agents are truly random.
# Experiment steps : 
# - the engine chooses an agent randomly (with replacement)
# - the agent places a random order on the market
# - the order goes in the buy or sellbook, depending on direction
# - the market clearing is immediately called, outputting any possible
#   transaction
# These steps are run 'daylength' times (20 if you use this file unmodified).
#
# Run with :
# $ python startfms.py run exp01.yml
# This should produce 2 files :
# - exp01.log is the logfile of the successive orders placed by the agents
#   this file might be "replayed" later by a special agent, see exp02.yml
# - exp01.csv is the resulting transactions file 
#
# You may try to :
# - remove the 'randomseed'
# - remove the outputfilename (output is then directed to stdout)
# - remove the orderslogfilename (no logfile of the orders)
#
